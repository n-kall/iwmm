## Overview

**IWMM** is an R package for adaptive importance sampling. The package implements the
importance weighted moment matching (IWMM) algorithm.
Given draws from a probability distribution, IWMM adapts the draws based on a given target distribution and an optional
expectation function. The draws can, but do not have to be from the distribution over which the expectation is defined.

The method is described in detail in the [Implicitly Adaptive Importance Sampling](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-020-09982-2) paper.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of iwmm from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("iwmm") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("topipa/iwmm") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("topipa/iwmm")
```

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(iwmm) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->

## Usage

IWMM takes a sample of draws, and functions that define the proposal and target distributions, as well as an optional
expectation function. Without an expectation function, the draws are adapted to match the proposal distribution.
If an expectation function is given, the expectation is computed after adapting the draws specifically for this expectation.

IWMM can also work with models fitted with [rstan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan) or [cmdstanr](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr)
where the fitted model posterior is treated as the proposal distribution.

### Example

Consider a simple univariate normal model (available
via `example_iwmm_model("normal_model")`):

```{stan, eval = F, output.var = "stanmod"}
data {
int<lower=0> N;
vector[N] x;
}
parameters {
  real mu;
  real log_sigma;
}
transformed parameters {
  real<lower=0> sigma = exp(log_sigma);
}
model {
  target += normal_lpdf(x | mu, sigma);
}
```

We first fit the model using Stan:

```{r, eval = T, cache=T, results='hide'}
library(iwmm)

normal_model <- example_iwmm_model("normal_model")

fit <- rstan::stan(
  model_code = normal_model$model_code,
  data = normal_model$data,
  refresh = FALSE,
  seed = 1234
)
```

After fitting the model, let us define an expectation function that we are interested in,
and compute the expectation:

```{r, eval = T}
expectation_fun_first_moment <- function(draws, ...) {
  draws
}

first_moment <- moment_match(
  fit,
  expectation_fun = expectation_fun_first_moment
)
```

We can check that the expectation matches the posterior mean

```{r, eval = T}
first_moment$expectation
colMeans(as.matrix(fit))[c("mu", "log_sigma")]
```
